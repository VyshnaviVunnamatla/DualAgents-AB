# DualAgents-AB

[Live Demo](https://dual-agents-ab.vercel.app/)  

DualAgents-AB is a web application that implements a dual-agent A/B testing framework (or dual-agent architecture). It consists of a frontend UI and a backend API, enabling experiments, user interactions, and data collection for analysis.

## Features

- Dual-agent A/B testing setup  
- Frontend interface for user interactions / experiment display  
- Backend API for experiment logic, data logging, and serving variants  
- Easy to extend for new experiments, metrics, or variants  

---

## Architecture

The project is divided into two main parts:

1. **Frontend**: React / Next.js (or similar) application that shows experiment UI, collects user actions, and interacts with backend.  
2. **Backend**: Node.js (or similar) REST API that manages experiments, assigns variants to users, records results, and aggregates data.

The frontend and backend communicate over HTTP (or RESTful) endpoints.

The dual-agent concept allows two “agents” (e.g. two different A/B logic engines or variant selection strategies) to run in parallel or compare. (You can explain your variant logic / agent behavior here.)

## Tech Stack

| Layer     | Technology / Library         |
|-----------|-------------------------------|
| Frontend  | React, Next.js, or your choice |
| Backend   | Node.js, Express (or your chosen framework) |
| Data store | (e.g. MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or your DB) |
| Deployment | Vercel (frontend), (other host for backend) |

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (>= version X.X.X)  
- npm or yarn  
- (Optional) Database (e.g. MongoDB, PostgreSQL) — if your backend persists data  

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VyshnaviVunnamatla/DualAgents-AB.git
cd DualAgents-AB
